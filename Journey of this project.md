Initial problem statement:
make a text summarizer for user terms and condition popups that occur on every website. Thinking from an industry level perspective checking condition boxes may not be that easy as by doing that you are officially granting permissions which can cause you to lose lawsuits in courts.

End goal is to make a chrome extension. Suppose a person working in a company accesses a particular service that asks for T&C conditions and permissions while signing up for that service, the chrome extension should read and summarize that text in a popup on the same screen without the need of user to copy paste the complete text and then derive a summary. It shouldnt be of hastle to the user and since T&C is hardly read by anyone and just skiped within seconds, the extension must also do it in somewhat similar time

Key problems/figureouts/concepts

1. ðŸ§¾ Where Is T&C Text Primarily Written on Websites?
In most real-world cases, T&C (Terms and Conditions) text is written in standard HTML, but there are variations based on how it's displayed.
âœ… 1. Plain HTML Pages â€“ ðŸŸ¢ Most Common
Structure: T&C is written in <div>, <p>, <section>, or <article> tags on a standalone page like:
âœ… Easy to access using document.querySelector or content script
ðŸŸ¢ Most websites follow this format

âœ… 2. Scroll Boxes on Signup Pages
Structure: A modal or signup form has a scrollable <div> (with overflow: scroll) containing the entire T&C.
âœ… Still HTML, just not fully visible unless scrolled
ðŸ“Œ Needs scroll simulation (scrollTop = scrollHeight) before extraction

Most of the success will come from extracting big HTML blocks with legal language (hundreds of characters, keywords like "privacy", "terms", "agree").
Your Chrome extensionâ€™s content script should prioritize:
  
  HTML pages
  Scrollable boxes
