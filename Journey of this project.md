Initial problem statement:
make a text summarizer for user terms and condition popups that occur on every website. Thinking from an industry level perspective checking condition boxes may not be that easy as by doing that you are officially granting permissions which can cause you to lose lawsuits in courts.

End goal is to make a chrome extension. Suppose a person working in a company accesses a particular service that asks for T&C conditions and permissions while signing up for that service, the chrome extension should read and summarize that text in a popup on the same screen without the need of user to copy paste the complete text and then derive a summary. It shouldnt be of hastle to the user and since T&C is hardly read by anyone and just skiped within seconds, the extension must also do it in somewhat similar time

✅ PROJECT OVERVIEW: Your Idea in My Words
Title:
T&C Summarizer Chrome Extension
"Making unread Terms & Conditions readable, responsible, and instant"

🧠 Problem You’re Solving
Most users blindly accept Terms & Conditions (T&C) while signing up for websites or services.

T&C documents are legally binding — meaning users might unknowingly grant permissions that can lead to data misuse or legal vulnerabilities.

Reading full T&Cs is time-consuming, confusing, and often skipped due to information overload and poor readability.

🎯 Objective
Build a Chrome extension that:

Automatically detects and extracts T&C text from the webpage (especially popups or separate T&C pages),

Sends it to an NLP-based summarization backend (Python API),

Returns a short, readable summary shown in a popup on the same screen, within a few seconds — without requiring the user to copy-paste anything.

🔩 Core Components (Modules)
1. Chrome Extension (Frontend in JS)
Detect and extract T&C content from webpages

Send it to backend API

Display summarized result in popup

2. Summarization Engine (Python Backend)
Receives raw legal T&C text

Applies NLP to summarize

Optionally flags risky clauses like: “We collect personal data...”, “We may share your data...”, etc.

Returns concise, readable summary

💡 Target Users
Professionals who quickly sign up for web tools, SaaS products, services

Legal-conscious users who want quick visibility into what they are signing up for

Security-conscious IT teams or developers vetting tools

🚀 Key Features (MVP Scope)

✅ Summarization	Fast summarization using extractive or pretrained models
✅ Chrome popup	Clean UI in Chrome popup to show result
✅ One-click operation	User doesn't need to copy-paste
⚠️ Risky clause highlighting (opt.)	Optional flagging of data-sharing, privacy issues
📂 Lightweight, fast	Delivers results in under ~5 seconds

🔍 What You’ve Prioritized
Speed & simplicity (done in seconds, not minutes)

No copy-paste — fully automated workflow

Legal significance — helping users make informed decisions

Industry relevance — this is a real-world problem that companies actually face

📈 Scope for Optimization & Growth
Area	Optimization Ideas
🧠 NLP Quality	Use better models: BART, T5, Legal-BERT, or fine-tuned LLMs for legal language
💬 Risk Alerts	Use pattern matching or ML to flag dangerous permissions or vague clauses
💾 Caching	Store summaries for repeated websites so API isn’t called again
👥 User Preferences	Allow toggling: “Flag risks,” “Highlight personal data,” etc.
📊 Analytics	Show how many risky clauses you’ve avoided over time
🔒 Privacy Focus	Encrypt user queries and data, or make it fully local (advanced)
🌍 Internationalization	Support multi-language T&Cs (e.g., translate then summarize)
🧩 Integrations	Make it compatible with other browsers (Firefox), or build a mobile-friendly version (PWA)

🧭 Long-Term Vision
Enterprise version: Offer this tool to companies for internal security/legal vetting.

SaaS Tool: Allow users to paste or upload T&C PDFs/URLs to get instant summaries.

Policy Scanner: Expand to include privacy policies, cookie policies, and software licenses.
